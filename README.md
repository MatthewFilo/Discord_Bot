Howdy hey!

Trying my hand at a discord bot to use for me and my friends in our discord server. Right now I am learning the Discord Bot Library from https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html and starting off programming out the basic commands that every bot has, but eventually want to do fun things with the bot such as a built-in trivia game and an emulation of the Mudae pokemon roll bot!
